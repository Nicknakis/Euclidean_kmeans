# Euclidean_kmeans 

Python 3.8.3 and Pytorch 1.12.1 implementation of divisive clustering based on Lloyds algorithm and the the Euclidean norm.

## Description

Existing k-means clustering algorithms rely on the squared Euclidean norm distances, and thus Euclidean norms are unfortunately not accounted for. We therefore presently derive an optimization procedure for k-means clustering with the Euclidean norm utilizing an auxiliary function framework yielding closed-form updates until convergence.

Such a divisive clustering procedure relies on the following Euclidean norm objective:

where $k$ denotes the cluster id, $z_{i}$ is the i'th data observation, $r_{ik}$ the cluster responsibility/assignment, and $\mu_k$ the cluster centroid.




We define an auxiliary function as:

where $\phi$ are the auxiliary variables. 
Thereby, minimizing Equation $J^+$ with respect to $\phi_{nk}$ yields:

$\phi_{ik}^*=||\mathbf{z}_i-\mu_k||_2$ 

and by plugging $\phi_{ik}^*$ back to $J^+$ we obtain:

$J^+(\phi^*,\mathbf{r},\mu)=J(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{\mu})$ 

verifying that  $J^+$ is indeed a valid auxiliary function for  $J$. 

The algorithm proceeds by optimizing cluster centroids as:

and assigning points to centroids as:

upon which $\phi_k$ is updated. The overall complexity of this procedure is $\mathcal{O}(TKND)$ where $T$ is the number of iterations required to converge.

### Additional packages

Our Pytorch implementation uses the [pytorch_sparse](https://github.com/rusty1s/pytorch_sparse) package. Installation guidelines can be found at the corresponding [Github repository](https://github.com/rusty1s/pytorch_sparse).

#### For a cpu installation please use: 

```pip install torch-scatter torch-sparse -f https://data.pyg.org/whl/torch-1.12.1+cpu.html```

#### For a gpu installation please use:

```pip install torch-scatter torch-sparse -f https://data.pyg.org/whl/torch-1.12.1+${CUDA}.html```

where ${CUDA} should be replaced by either cu102, cu113, or cu116 depending on your PyTorch installation.
